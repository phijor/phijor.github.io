## An Environment for Interactive Development

So far, we have only run Agda through the various `nix` sub-commands.
Agda however excels when being used interactively from within an editor.
Our goal is to make the flake-based setup compatible with interactive editing.

### Agda on demand with `nix develop`

Recall that [earlier](./03-project-skeleton.md),
we declared a [shell environment][nix-dev-shell] in `flake.nix`:

```nix
{{#include ./agda-playground/flake.nix:shell}}
```

This allows us to enter a shell that exposes all *inputs* to the derivations listed in `inputsFrom`.
In particular, those of `defaultPackage` â€” the Agda library we declared in `playground.nix`.
One of its inputs is `agda` itself,
and we can make it available in a new shell by invoking `nix develop`:[^bash-prompt]

```shellsession
$ nix develop --bash-prompt "agda-env> "
agda-env> which agda # Agda as pinned by flake.lock
/nix/store/48wvmiiiw3cr6sjh38vp695h81kyzysj-agdaWithPackages-2.6.2.2/bin/agda
```

Inside this shell, we can access a version of Agda that knows of our `standard-library` dependency,
and type-checking our library succeeds:

```shellsession
agda-env> agda Everything.agda
Checking Everything (/[...]/agda-playground/Everything.agda).
 Checking Playground.Hello (/[...]/agda-playground/Playground/Hello.agda).
 Checking Playground.WithStdlib (/[...]/agda-playground/Playground/WithStdlib.agda).
```

`````admonish tip title="Details: _How Agda finds dependencies_" collapsible=true
When using `agdaPackages.mkDerivation` to build our package, the real `agda` binary is wrapped with extra arguments.
These arguments tell agda where to search for modules provided by other libraries:

````shellsession
agda-env> cat $(which agda)
#! /nix/store/dsd5gz46hdbdk2rfdimqddhq6m8m8fqs-bash-5.1-p16/bin/bash -e
exec "/nix/store/8i6s0m32mgcvd4vlakw752n40d6gkgsd-Agda-2.6.2.2/bin/agda" \
    --with-compiler=/nix/store/q468289jr01p5p2lllfs1s99wggbw00g-ghc-9.0.2-with-packages/bin/ghc \
    --library-file=/nix/store/2r00jip3577bzvmw79pb0rwqq3czhmq9-libraries \
    --local-interfaces "$@"
````

The flag `--library-file=<...>` receives as an argument a file containing paths to all libraries in which search for modules:

````shellsession
agda-env> cat /nix/store/2r00jip3577bzvmw79pb0rwqq3czhmq9-libraries
/nix/store/bj9k8disw7pjmwbybniqmafzgrfbk6zg-standard-library-1.7.1/standard-library.agda-lib
````
`````

This environment also contains `agda-mode`, the program that powers interactive editing in many editors.
If you've set up Emacs following the [official instructions][agda-mode],
`emacs` run from inside this shell should pick up our custom Agda environment:

```shellsession
agda-env> emacs Playground.WithStdlib # Loading the buffer (C-c C-l) should work.
```

I personally use Neovim together with [Cornelis] to work on Agda projects,
and that works like a charm from inside this shell!

### Automatically loading the environment

It is somewhat cumbersome to load this environment every time we want to hack on some code.
Not only does it take time to instantiate the shell,
the shell itself is also rather bare-bones.
This is rather upsetting for anyone who has put time into customizing their interactive shell!

We are going to automate the process of loading the environment by using [direnv],
together with its Nix integration provided by [nix-direnv].
`direnv` works by hooking your shell and running some code whenever
you change into a directory containing a file called `.envrc`.
It is there that we put the instructions to load the Agda environment.

Go and follow the official installation instructions to install both `direnv` and `nix-direnv`.
I use [home-manager] to manage my user programs,
so this is as easy as
[enabling `direnv`](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.direnv.enable)
and [`nix-direnv`](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.direnv.nix-direnv.enable).
We can then go ahead and write our hook to load the Agda environment,
and put it on `direnv`'s list of allowed environments:[^direnv-allow]

```shellsession
$ echo "use flake" > .envrc # Write flake hook to .envrc
$ direnv allow # Allow loading *this* .envrc
direnv: loading /[...]/agda-playground/.envrc
direnv: using flake
direnv: nix-direnv: renewed cache
$
```

```admonish tip title="Details: _<code>direnv</code> caching_" collapsible=true
In the above output, `nix-direnv` tells us that it has renewed its *cache*:
Flake environments are cached per directory
and therefore load almost instantaneously when changing directory!
```

Notice how were not thrown into a subshell, as opposed to when using `nix develop`.
We are still in the same interactive shell as before, but `direnv` has
set up the environment (e.g. by modifying the `$PATH`) to give us access to
the shell environment defined in our flake.
We should now have access to Agda in our shell!

```shellsession
$ which agda
/nix/store/48wvmiiiw3cr6sjh38vp695h81kyzysj-agdaWithPackages-2.6.2.2/bin/agda
```

Since I am using Neovim from the shell directly, it picks up the custom environment.
This might not be the case if you are launching your editor from elsewhere,
perhaps a desktop shortcut or an application launcher.
In this case you might want to consider a plug-in for your editor
that provides `direnv` integration, such as:

- _VSCode_: [`direnv/direnv-vscode`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv-vscode)
- _Emacs_: [`wbolster/emacs-direnv`](https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv)

### Conclusion

You should now have a reproducible, per-project Agda environment
that is loaded automatically whenever you hack on files in a project!

[^bash-prompt]: Passing `--bash-prompt` is optional.
    We do it here to distinguish between the different shells.

[^direnv-allow]: `direnv` will not blindly execute an `.envrc` it finds in the current directory.
    You have to explicitly allow the automatic execution of these files.
    By issuing `direnv allow`, the `.envrc` in the current directory
    is put onto `direnv`'s allow-list.
    This can be reverted by issuing `direnv revoke`.
